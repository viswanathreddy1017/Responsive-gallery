# Responsive-gallery
This is lab activity of responsive gallery manipulating js and hovering images toggling between the modes.

 if we disable JavaScript in our browser the images are still visible.
This is progressive enhancement → the site’s core function (image viewing) works even without JS.

If we try resizing the browser window the gallery layout and the images adjust/rearrange to fit the screen.
That’s responsive design → using CSS techniques like Grid or Flexbox and media queries to adapt to different devices.

If we add JavaScript features, like a dark/light mode toggle or filtering by category is an enhancement, not the foundation.
Enhancements improve usability, but the foundation (HTML + CSS) ensures accessibility.
